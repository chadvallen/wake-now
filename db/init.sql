('wakeboard', 'Lunchtray 2019 Hyperlite Wakeboard', 'More than 2 years of testing and exploration have gone into the Lunchtray, our newest deck to join Hyperlite''s Cable Collective. Mastermind shaper Aaron Stumpf, who brought us the Union, has engineered flex zones into the tip and tail so wakeboarders can press away while the flex under foot remains flawless. While pressing, the tip and tail are reinforced with laminate to laminate urethane for ultimate durability. Enjoy a slightly beveled edge at 10 degrees for forgiveness and the hourglass base tunnel for a softer landing. Created atop an Abrupt Continuous Rocker, banded with Urethane Sidewalls and a look like no other, the Lunchtray is sure to be a new favorite at the park.', 'http://assets.hosports.com/image.php?src=2019/img/wakeboards-lunchtray1.png&w=600&h=600&zc=2', 560),

('wakeboard', 'State 2.0 2019 Hyperlite Wakeboard', 'Advancing your skills quicker with advanced shape technology. A complete entry level deck. Creating a shape to take riders'' skills to the next level was the goal behind the new State 2.0. Learning from other asymmetrical designs, we found that creating a shorter but more effective edge on a rider''s toe-side made hard to learn wake jumps that much easier. This is because there is less rail to initiate when applying toe-side pressure. Once set, the smoother toe-side transition is then held by the State 2.0''s thinner profile molded-in fin, creating less drag and a better release off the top of the wake. Subtle Toe-Side Footbed Risers were also added to help a rider create more leverage when pressure is applied. The longer, more traditional heel-side edge compliments this asymmetrical design by allowing the natural body position of a rider to generate stability and speed into the wake without a loss of pop due to reduced surface area. The State 2.0 has been tested and proven to be the best choice for a rider looking to master the foundations of wakeboarding.', 'http://assets.hosports.com/image.php?src=2019/img/wakeboards-state1.png&w=600&h=600&zc=2', 275),

The Syndicate PRO is built with a Full Carbon Jacket, a carbon fiber wrapped top and base adds even more carbon to this skis carbon fiber rich interior. This abundance of high performance aerospace carbon fiber results in a lighter, stiffer ski with more responsiveness than ever before. The Narrow Width Profile with Aggressive Tail Taper turns and rolls on edge easily to generate massive amounts of angle. It''s large bevel size in tail results in increased hold at the finish of the turn. This means high angle turns with less blowouts. A deep concave helps control speed by allowing quicker deceleration for tight turns with a tight rope. The PRO''s Pre-Flexed Continuous Rockerline allows the skier to turn predictably no matter where they stand on the ski meaning you needn''t be perfectly balanced to get the PRO to turn well.

There are tons of handles, two towing orientations, and the riding positions are only limited by your own imagination.', 'http://assets.hosports.com/image.php?src=2019/img/tubes-molecule1.png&w=600&h=600&zc=2', 650),
